# MJRPhtmlPreview

## Core Objective
A frictionless tool to paste HTML, preview it instantly, and save it to Google Drive or a local Obsidian vault in one click.

## The Vibe
Minimal Dark — dark background (#0d1117), monospace typography (JetBrains Mono), cyan/green accents (#58a6ff / #3fb950). Developer tool aesthetic — clean, fast, zero clutter.

## User Empathy
When working with AI tools (Cowork, Claude, ChatGPT), you constantly generate HTML outputs but have no quick way to preview them and save them in an organized way. Copy-pasting into files manually is tedious. This tool eliminates that friction: paste → see → save.

## Design DNA
Think GitHub's dark mode meets a code playground (CodePen/JSFiddle) but stripped to the essentials. No accounts, no complexity — just paste, preview, save.
